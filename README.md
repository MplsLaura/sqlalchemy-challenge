# Description

I've decided to go to Honolulu, Hawaii on a long vacation. I did a climate analysis about the area.


# Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Using Python and SQLAlchemy I did a basic climate analysis and data exloration of some really old data. It's like I don't believe in climate change.

# Climate App

Once I completed the initial analysis, I designed a Flask API based on the queries. I would like to share this old data with everyone because of it's usefulness.
